This program checks if a password has been compromised using the pwnedpasswords API with K-Anonimity model.

## ü§îMotivation
I am really interested in getting into the field of Computer Science and particularly Cybersecurity and Criptography. Buiding Password Checker to me was a brief introduction of some tools that can be used on that field.

## ‚ùó How it works

### hashlib Module
By using this module, we can offer protection to the password.

### The inputpass() Function

```python
def inputpass():
    password_storer = []
    clientpass = input('Please input your password: ')
    with open('./Password.txt', 'w+') as createuserpassword:
        createuserpassword.write(f'{clientpass}')
    
    with open('./Password.txt', 'r') as userpassword:
        userpass = userpassword.read()
        password_storer.append(userpass)
    return password_storer
```
This function writes the password that the user will input in the terminal to a .txt file. The text in that file will later be encrypted using SHA-1.

### The main() Function

```python
def main():
    for password in inputpass():
        count = api_checkpwned(password)
        securepass = len(password) * '*'
        if count:
            print(f'{securepass} was found {count} times.')
        else:
            print(f'{securepass} was not found.')
    
    with open('./Password.txt', 'w+') as final:
        encrypted = hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest().upper()
        final.write(f'{encrypted}')

```        
This function gets the password from inputpass() and creates "count", that will be the number of times the password was found.

It then prints the number of time it was found and edits the Password.txt file that was created in inputpass().

### The api_checkpwned() Function

```python
def api_checkpwned(password):
    sha1passwrd = hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest().upper()
    usable, nonusable = sha1passwrd[:5], sha1passwrd[5:]
    response2 = request_api_data(usable)
    return getpsswrd_leaks_count(response2, nonusable)
```
This function will encrypt the password using SHA-1, and crop the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 encrypted string. Then, it will send those 5 characters to request_api_data() and return getpsswrd_leaks_count()

### The request_api_data() Function 

```python
def request_api_data(query_chars):
    url = 'https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/' + str(query_chars)
    Response = requests.get(url)
    if Response.status_code != 200:
        raise RuntimeError(f'Error: {Response.status_code}, check the API and try again.')
    return Response
```
This function will give us the number of times the password has been found using the pwnedpasswords API. It will search using the first five characters of the SHA-1 encrypted password (K-Anonimity).

That is the moment we will know if the password has been compromised or not.

### The get_psswrd_leaks_count()
```python
def getpsswrd_leaks_count(hashes, checkhash):
    hashes = (line.split(':') for line in hashes.text.splitlines())
    for h, count in hashes:
        if h == checkhash:
            return count
    return 0
```
As the name suggests, this function will finally return us the count that will be displayed to the user. It compares the output of request_api_data() with the rest of the encrypted strings (that is, everything but the first five characters). If that comparison is true, we output the count. If not, we output 0.

### Back to main()
```python
def main():
    for password in inputpass():
        count = api_checkpwned(password)
        securepass = len(password) * '*'
        if count:
            print(f'{securepass} was found {count} times.')
        else:
            print(f'{securepass} was not found.')
    
    with open('./Password.txt', 'w+') as final:
        encrypted = hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest().upper()
        final.write(f'{encrypted}')
```
Now that we have the count, we can display it to the user.
